What was the biggest challenge of scraping the web site?
  The biggest challenge for me was the scraping of the individual rating and getting the page to click the next symbol. I couldn't find the find figure out what the main identity to find the rating plus whether to use Class_Name or Tag_Name. Then with the next button I had everything going good until someone decides to change the next symbol on the website to something different and took me hours and days to finally go back to the page and see that somebody change the page. Then my unique id started not working and had to switch to use data for ID.
  
  What insight, if any, did you gain from the analysis and visualization of the laptop data?
    I learn to always check the website even if you think the coding is right because there can be changes made to that website. I learn how to use data to make ID for scraping. I gain the knowledge to know that getting the data first and learning what to do when making a graph or some type of visualization is key.
